CRAZY IDEAS:
Linked Turrets: some turrets are linked, that is you cant reduce their HP under 50% until all of them are at 50%.
Damage Type: There are different damage types, some turrets are inmune to their own fire type, you cant use their own bullets.
Obstacles: (requirement: Damage Type) there are obstacles that force you to reflect bullets between two turrets because each are inmune to their own bullets. and there is no straight path between them
ShieldedTurrets: some turrets generate a shield and should all of them receive damage in a small period of time
Moving turrets: the turrets move


TODO:
if a turret wants to fire it has to have enough energy
the turrets follow the hero



DONE:

when a bullet goes out of bounds it dissapears
the bullets fly in a straight line
when a turret is in range of the hero it can fire
the turrets should fire at the hero
when a turret is hit by a bullet it receives damage which reduces the turret's health
when the health of a turret reaches 0 it dies
when a turret dies it explodes
